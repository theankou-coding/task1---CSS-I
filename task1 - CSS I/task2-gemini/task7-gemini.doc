Online Fonts and Favicons
Online Fonts
Online fonts are fonts that are hosted on a server and can be accessed and used on websites without having to download and install them locally. This offers a convenient way to use a wide variety of fonts on your website, ensuring consistency across different devices and browsers.

Using Google Fonts:

Google Fonts is a popular service that provides a vast library of free, high-quality fonts. To use Google Fonts in your HTML document, follow these steps:

Choose Fonts: Visit the Google Fonts website (https://fonts.google.com/) and select the fonts you want to use.
Generate Code: Click the "Select" button next to each font, then click the "View code" button.
Embed the Code: Copy the generated code and paste it into the <head> section of your HTML document.
Example:

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com">
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap"   
 rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    </body>
</html>   

Use code with caution.

Favicons

Add to HTML: Place the .ico file in your website's directory and add the following code to the <head> section of your HTML document:

CSS Selectors: Targeting Elements
CSS selectors are used to specify which HTML elements should be affected by a particular CSS rule. They act as a way to identify and address specific elements within an HTML document.

Types of CSS Selectors
Element Selector: Targets elements based on their tag name.
Class Selector: Targets elements that have a specific class attribute.
ID Selector: Targets a single element with a unique ID attribute.
Attribute Selector: Targets elements based on their attributes.
Pseudo-Class Selector: Targets elements based on their state or condition.
Example HTML Document
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>CSS Selectors Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="myHeading">This is a heading</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">This is a paragraph.</p>
    <a href="https://example.com">Link to Example</a>
    <button>Click me</button>

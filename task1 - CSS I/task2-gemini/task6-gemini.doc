Styling Text and Fonts in CSS
CSS provides a wide range of properties for customizing the appearance of text on a web page. Here are some common properties and an example demonstrating their usage:

Properties
font-family: Sets the font family to use for text.
font-size: Specifies the size of the font.
font-weight: Controls the boldness of the font (e.g., normal, bold, bolder).
text-align: Aligns the text within its container (e.g., left, center, right).
color: Sets the color of the text.
text-decoration: Adds decorations like underline or line-through.
Example HTML and CSS
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Text Styling Example</title>
    <style>
        h1 {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            font-size: 36px;
            font-weight: bold;
            text-align: center;
        }

        p {
            font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;
            font-size: 18px;
            color: #666666;
        }

        a {
            color: blue;
            text-decoration: underline;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph with <a href="#">a link</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>

Explanation
Heading: The <h1> element uses the Arial font family, is 36 pixels in size, is bold, and is centered.
Paragraph: The <p> elements use the Verdana font family, are 18 pixels in size, and have a gray color.
Link: The <a> element has a blue color and is underlined.
You can experiment with different values for these properties to achieve the desired appearance for your text. For example, you can use font-weight: 700 for a bolder font or text-decoration: none to remove the underline from a link.

Applying Styles Directly to HTML Elements
Inline styles allow you to apply CSS properties directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute. This provides granular control over specific elements but can make your HTML code less readable and maintainable.

Example HTML Document with Inline Styles
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Inline Styles Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 style="color: red; font-size: 48px;">This is a heading</h1>
    <p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 24px;">This is a paragraph.</p>
    <a href="https://example.com" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">Link to Example</a>
</body>
</html>

In this example:

The <h1> element has color: red; font-size: 48px; applied directly.
The <p> element has font-family: Arial; font-size: 24px; applied directly.
The <a> element has color: blue; text-decoration: none; applied directly.
Pros and Cons of Inline Styles
Pros:

Granular control: Allows for precise styling of individual elements.
Quick fixes: Can be useful for making small, temporary changes.
Cons:

Reduced readability: Clutters HTML code, making it harder to maintain and understand.
Lack of reusability: Styles cannot be easily reused across multiple elements.
Separation of concerns: Violates the principle of separating content from presentation.
In general, it is recommended to use external stylesheets for most CSS styling to improve code organization, maintainability, and reusability. 
Inline styles should be used sparingly for specific cases where granular control is necessary and the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

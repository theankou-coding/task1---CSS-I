CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's a language used to style HTML elements. 
It controls the look and layout of a web page, including colors, fonts, spacing, and more.

Role of CSS in Web Development
Separation of Concerns: CSS allows for a clean separation of content (HTML) and presentation (CSS), making websites easier to maintain and update.
Consistent Appearance: CSS ensures a consistent look across different web browsers and devices.
Enhanced User Experience: Well-designed CSS can improve the overall user experience by making websites more visually appealing and easier to navigate.

=====================HTML===================
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First CSS Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>

=====================CSS===================
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
    color: white;
    font-size: 48px;
}

p {
    color: black;
    font-size: 24px;
}

How it works:

The HTML document includes a <link> element to link the styles.css file.
The CSS rules in styles.css are applied to the corresponding HTML elements.
The browser renders the page according to the styles defined in the CSS.
This simple example demonstrates how CSS can be used to quickly and easily modify the appearance of a web page.

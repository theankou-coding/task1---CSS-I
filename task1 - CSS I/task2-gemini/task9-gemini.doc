CSS Alignment and Display Properties
CSS provides various properties to control the alignment and layout of elements on a web page.

Alignment Properties
text-align: Aligns the text within an element (left, center, right, justify).
vertical-align: Aligns the content of an inline element vertically relative to other elements (baseline, top, middle, bottom).
float: Positions an element to the left or right of its container, allowing other elements to wrap around it.
position: Sets the positioning of an element (static, relative, absolute, fixed).
Display Properties
display: block: Elements are displayed as blocks, taking up the full width of their container and starting on a new line.
display: inline: Elements are displayed inline, without starting on a new line.
display: inline-block: Elements are displayed inline but can have padding, margin, and width/height properties like block elements.
display: flex: Enables flexible box layout, allowing elements to be arranged and aligned in various ways.
Example HTML and CSS
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Alignment Example</title>
    <style>
        .text-center {
            text-align: center;
        }

        .vertical-middle {
            vertical-align: middle;
        }

        .float-left {
            float: left;
        }

        .absolute-position {
            position: absolute;
            top: 100px;
            left: 100px;
        }

        .flex-container {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: space-between;
            align-items: center;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="text-center">This text is centered.</div>

    <div>
        <span class="vertical-middle">This text is vertically aligned to the middle.</span>
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" class="vertical-middle">
    </div>

    <div class="float-left">This text floats to the left.</div>
    <p>This text wraps around the floated element.</p>

    <div class="absolute-position">This element is positioned absolutely.</div>

    <div class="flex-container">
        <div>Item 1</div>
        <div>Item 2</div>
        <div>Item 3</div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>

Explanation
Text Alignment: The .text-center class centers the text within its container.
Vertical Alignment: The .vertical-middle class vertically aligns the text and image to the middle.
Floating: The .float-left class floats the element to the left, allowing other content to wrap around it.
Absolute Positioning: The .absolute-position class positions the element absolutely, relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block.
Flexbox: The .flex-container class uses flexbox to arrange items in a row and distribute them evenly using justify-content: space-between and align them vertically using align-items: center.
By understanding and utilizing these alignment and display properties, you can effectively control the layout and appearance of your web page elements.

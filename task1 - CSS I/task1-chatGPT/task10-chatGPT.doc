<!-- The CSS box model is a fundamental concept in web design and layout that describes how elements are structured and how their dimensions and spacing are calculated. It consists of four components:

Content: The actual content of the box, such as text or images. It defines the width and height of the box.
Padding: The space between the content and the border. It is transparent and can be adjusted to create space within the box.
Border: The line that surrounds the padding (if any) and the content. The border can have various styles (solid, dashed, etc.), widths, and colors.
Margin: The space outside the border. It creates distance between the box and surrounding elements and is also transparent. -->

<!-- Visual Representation
Padding increases the internal space, making the content look more spacious.
Margin increases the external space, affecting how close the boxes are to one another.
Border changes the visual boundary, giving the box more definition.

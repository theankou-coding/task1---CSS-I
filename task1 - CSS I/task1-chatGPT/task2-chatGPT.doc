<!-- Differences between Inline, Internal, and External CSS
Inline CSS:
CSS rules are applied directly within an HTML element using the style attribute.

Advantage: Quick to apply for small, one-time changes.
Disadvantage: Difficult to maintain and reuse; increases HTML code size.
Internal CSS:
CSS rules are placed inside a <style> tag within the <head> section of the HTML page.

Advantage: Useful for styling a single page without affecting others.
Disadvantage: Not reusable across multiple pages.
External CSS:
CSS is written in a separate file with a .css extension and linked to the HTML file.

Advantage: Styles can be reused across multiple pages, improving maintainability.
Disadvantage: Requires an extra HTTP request to load the CSS file, which may slightly affect page load time. -->

Advantages and Disadvantages
Method	Advantages	Disadvantages
Inline CSS	- Quick to apply for single elements
- No need for separate files	- Not reusable
- Hard to maintain with large projects
Internal CSS	- Good for single-page styles
- Keeps CSS centralized for the page	- Not reusable across multiple pages
- Can bloat the HTML file
External CSS	- Reusable across multiple pages
- Keeps HTML clean	- Requires separate HTTP request
- External file must be loaded
============================================================================
Summary
This example demonstrates the inline, internal, and external CSS methods. Each method has its own use case:

Use inline CSS for quick, one-off styles.
Use internal CSS for page-specific styling.
Use external CSS for styles that need to be applied consistently across multiple pages.
Understanding these differences helps you decide which method to use based on the needs of your project. -->

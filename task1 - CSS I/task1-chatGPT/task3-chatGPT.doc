<!-- CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements. They define which HTML elements will be affected by a specific set of CSS rules. Selectors allow developers to apply styles based on element names, classes, IDs, attributes, and more.

Types of CSS Selectors
Element Selector: Targets all elements with a specific HTML tag.
Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class name.
ID Selector: Targets an element with a specific ID.
Attribute Selector: Targets elements based on their attributes.
Pseudo-class Selector: Targets elements based on their state (like hover, focus) or their position in the document.

<!-- Summary
This example demonstrates how various CSS selectors can be used to style HTML elements:

Element selectors are general and apply to all instances of an element.
Class selectors are more specific and allow for reusable styles across multiple elements.
ID selectors are used for unique elements that need individual styling.
Attribute selectors allow targeting elements with specific attributes.
Pseudo-class selectors apply styles to elements in a specific state (like hover) or position (like the first child).
Using the right selectors ensures clean, maintainable, and efficient CSS. -->
